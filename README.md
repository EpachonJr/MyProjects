# Investment Projects

In this Repository you will find all my personal projects using programming languages to create analysis over investments. 

**"Analysing Brazil Stocks with Python - Ranking Valuable Companies that are currently Cheap"** - My first personal project. It was based on **"Ricos pelo Acaso"** youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzCrdOO2GLYVnNhZUvG03lg), adapted with my personal inputs.

**"Predicting US Stock Prices using Random Walk Model"** - Created a model that predicts future prices for any US stock. Keep in mind that this model serves to get a sense of how possibly a stock will behave in the future. The model does not consider political variables, for example, which impairs its assertiveness.
